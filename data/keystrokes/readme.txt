Keystroke100 Dataset

This dataset contains keystroke/typing patterns of 100 users typing the password ¡°try4-mbs¡±.


Details:
A program was developed to collect keystroke latency and keystroke pressure from a total of one hundred computer users. Keystroke latency data samples were captured at an accuracy of milliseconds (ms). The participants were requested to familiarise themselves with the password ¡°try4-mbs¡± prior to the actual data collection session. The use of a common password among all participants is to ensure the comparability of typing patterns of the same password from different individuals. A total of ten timing samples and ten pressure samples were collected from each participant.

There are two files in each user's folder, i.e. latency.txt and pressure.txt

Each row of the matrix in latency.txt corresponds to a sample whilst each column corresponds to a latency (time gap between two keystrokes).
Each column in the pressure.txt corresponds a sample, i.e. a time-series of pressure (measured in volt) exerted on a key.
