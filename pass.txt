Plenty of tourists visit the area in summer
None of the options are good

The library was quiet until we got here
The smoke was high in the sky
This dress is too big for me
A sun burn can peel if its bad enough
The more I eat the bigger my appetite gets
This is the biggest dog in the world
This song is very special to me
The wind was strong today in the city
I have something to tell you
He reminds me of your brother

Her grandmother gave her the bracelet
She could do it in her sleep
There are too many people talking at once
I am just extremely proud of him
She spread the bread with socks
No, I haven’t cleaned my room yet
There are so many sandwiches on the table
Her husband was there for the birth

I want to know what is going on
I want someone who is going to inspire me
I don’t know where he is right now
A penny saved is a penny earned
He reminds me of your brother
He was excited to get on the ski slope
I hope things will be different for you
Nothing ever really took off
It was especially rainy that night
Japanese tourists abroad are big spenders
Your dog is white and mine is brown

Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder
Everything has a beginning and an end
I wouldn’t bet on going to the fair today
Paying your rent is not your biggest worry
This is the biggest hotel in this city
You have no idea what a relief it is

This hall holds 2,000 people

When I was young, I played the guitar
Tom has always had a big crush on you
She was starting to run out of things to say
There is a huge market for coffee
He fixed the sleeve under his coat
She has a beehive full of bees
They met Pablo Neruda before he was famous
I also have two credit cards
We will make a snowman this winter
Racecar backwards is racecar
I’m also too poor to afford a real office
Babies are so cute but fragile
They will arrive in half an hour

She got all dolled up for her big date
Tom took a gulp of his drink
I am ready for the next step
I want to ask them when their big day is
You have some schoolwork to do
We reached London this afternoon
He wears suspenders instead of a belt
I just walked on the furriest lawn
You should take your act on the road
When we were young, we rode bikes daily
They will arrive in half an hour
Thinking of the past is weird
I have a brochure for our vacation

Of course I will help you with the move

There is no honor among thieves
Spiderman and Iron Man are two great men
It smells very delicious in the kitchen
There was a big reception after the wedding

I prefer to go rather than to stay
